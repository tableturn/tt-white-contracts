## FastTokenFacet

### mint

```solidity
function mint(uint256 amount, string ref) external
```

Mints an amount of FAST tokens.
 A reference can be passed to identify why this happened for example.

Business logic:
- Modifiers:
  - Requires the caller to be a member of the Issuer contract.
- Requires that either the token has continuous supply, or that no tokens have been minted yet.
- Increases the reserve balance by `amount`.
- Calls `FastHistoryFacet.minted`.
- Calls `FastFrontendFacet.emitDetailsChanged`.
- Emits a `Minted(amount, ref)` event.

| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| amount | uint256 | The number of FAST tokens to mint. |
| ref | string | A reference for this minting operation. |

### burn

```solidity
function burn(uint256 amount, string ref) external
```

Burns an amount of FAST tokens.
 A reference can be passed to identify why this happened for example.

Business logic.
- Modifiers:
  - Requires the caller to be a member of the Issuer contract.
- Requires that the token has continuous supply.
- Requires that there are enough funds in the reserve to cover for `amount` being burnt.
- Decreases the reserve balance by `amount`.
- Calls `FastHistoryFacet.burnt(amount, ref)`.

### retrieveDeadTokens

```solidity
function retrieveDeadTokens(address holder) external
```

Allows an Issuer member to move an arbitrary account's holdings back to the reserve,
as per regulatory requirements.

Business logic:
- Modifiers:
  - Requires that the caller is a member of the Issuer contract.
- If the amount held by `holder` is not zero
  - The balance of `holder` should be set to zero.
  - The reserve's balance should be increased by how much was on the holder's account.
  - Total supply should be decreased by that amount too.
- The `holder`'s address should not be tracked as a token holder in this FAST anymore.
- The `holder`'s address should not be tracked as a token holder in the Marketplace anymore.
- A `Transfer(holder, reserve, amount)` event should be emited.
- If the amount previously held by `holder` was not zero,
  - Since the reserve balance and total supply have changed, the `FastFrontendFacet.emitDetailsChanged()` function should be called.

### performTransfer

```solidity
function performTransfer(struct FastTokenFacet.TransferArgs p) external
```

This is the internal method that gets called whenever a transfer is initiated. Both `transfer`,
`transferWithRef`, and their variants internally call this function.

Business logic:

  - Only facets of the current diamond should be able to call this.
- Requires that transfers are enabled for this FAST.
- Requires that `from` and `to` are different addresses.
- Requires that `from` membership is active in the marketplace.

- If `from` is the reserve, requires that the message sender is an issuer member.
- Requires that `to` is a valid token holder.
- Requires that the amount is a positive value.
- If the transfer is an allowance - e.g. the `spender` is not the same as the `from` address,
  - The allowance given by the `from` address to the `spender` covers for the `amount`.
    - If we are **not** transfering **from** the reserve,
      - Decreases the allowance given by `from` to `spender`.

          - Stop tracking the allowance in the allowance lookup tables for both spending and receiving directions.
- Decreases the balance of the `owner` address.
- Increases the balance of the `to` address by `amount`.
- If we are **not** transfering **from** the reserve,
  - Requires that there are enough transfer credits to cover for `amount`.
  - Decreases the transfer credits by `amount`.
- If the `to` address is the reserve,
  - Decreases the total supply by `amount`.
  - Calls `FastFrontendFacet.emitDetailsChanged`.
- Else, if the `from` address is the reserve,
